# Sound Files

This directory contains the sound files for the Flappy Bird game.

You need to add two audio files to this directory:
1. `boing.mp3` - A short "boing" sound effect for when the bird jumps
2. `celebration.mp3` - A celebratory sound effect for when a player gets on the leaderboard

You can find free sound effects at sites like:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
- [Pixabay Sounds](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

Make sure the files are named exactly as specified above and are in MP3 format.
